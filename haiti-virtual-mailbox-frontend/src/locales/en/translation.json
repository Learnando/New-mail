  "about": {
    "title": " Connecting Haiti to the World",
    "intro1": "Welcome to Bwat Lakay, a shipping and logistics platform created with one mission in mind: to bridge the gap between the global marketplace and the people of Haiti. Our service was born out of a deeply rooted understanding of the challenges faced by Haitians when it comes to shopping online, receiving packages, and accessing global commerce.",
    "intro2": "In a world where e-commerce is booming, Haiti has been left behind‚Äînot because of a lack of desire, but because of a lack of access. We're here to change that.",
    "problemTitle": "üåç The Problem We‚Äôre Solving",
    "problem1": "For years, individuals in Haiti have faced a unique set of problems when trying to shop or receive items internationally. Most people in Haiti do not have access to credit or debit cards, making it virtually impossible to shop on sites like Amazon, Walmart, or eBay.",
    "problem2": "Even those who do have access often struggle with unreliable shipping, expensive customs fees, or simply no physical address to receive packages. Haiti‚Äôs infrastructure doesn‚Äôt support direct-to-home delivery, and many homes lack official mailing addresses. Local shipping options are limited or unaffordable. For too long, people have had to rely on friends or family abroad‚Äîa solution that‚Äôs both unreliable and inconvenient.",
    "solutionTitle": "üì¶ Our Solution: A Smarter Way to Ship",
    "solution1": "At Bwat Lakay, we created a virtual mailbox and purchasing service tailored to Haiti. If you have a credit or debit card, you can use our app to submit your packages directly to our U.S. warehouse. Just enter your virtual address (e.g., HUB001-123456), include your phone number and tracking number, and choose air or sea, home delivery or pickup.",
    "solution2": "For users without payment cards, we built the ‚ÄúBuy For Me‚Äù service. Just tell us what you want, we‚Äôll confirm the price and a small service fee, and you can pay us locally. We'll handle the purchase and get it delivered to Haiti‚Äîno card required.",
    "whyTitle": "ü§ù Why We Care",
    "why": "We are Haitians. We‚Äôve watched family and friends miss chances to work, study, or care for loved ones simply because they couldn‚Äôt get what they needed. This platform is our way of creating real economic opportunity. We want Haitians to have a reliable, secure, and affordable path into the digital world‚Äîso no one gets left behind.",
    "visionTitle": "üöÄ Our Vision",
    "vision": "Commerce should be for everyone‚Äînot just people with a U.S. address or a Visa card. Our goal is to become the most trusted delivery and shopping assistant in Haiti. Whether it‚Äôs a book, a phone, school supplies, or household goods, we want every Haitian to know they can get it safely and affordably."
